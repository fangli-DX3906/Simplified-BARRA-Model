# Simplified-BARRA-Model

This project  is to implement a much simplified version of the BARRA model in the U.S. equity market. I construct excess returns on two quantitative equity strategies from July 1973 to January 2015. The initial 10 years (120 months) are reserved for model parameter estimation. The first strategy is the tangency portfolio (maximal Sharpe ratio). The second strategy is an optimal long-short portfolio with several constraints.
